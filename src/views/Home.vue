      <p>Completing this challenge was interesting. It's a relatively simple task done in a system I'm not fully fluent in yet, so I learned quite a lot in the process. It was made very clear to me, in both the instructions and when I asked for clarification, that this code test is as much a technical checkup (and it's clearly not more than that) as a serious examination of what a developer would do with vague requirements.</p>
      <p>As a rule, my first response to vague or ill-defined requirements is to go pester the stakeholder, PM, or whoever else is making this request for clarification. The vast majority of the time, vague requirements come from weak writing, and getting the person talking brings up all the detail I need. The rest of the time, the person making the request doesn't really know what they want, and can't give me more information. I'm treating this project like that. In this case, my preferred approach is to take the letter of the vague requirement and implement is as simply as possible, just to get something up on the screen quickly.</p>
      <p>My approach is that no matter how hard I try to suss out a correct answer from a vague requirement, it's a guess and I'm probably going to guess wrong. If I'm going to be wrong, better to fail fast and create something simple but tangible, and now I have a thing I can show the stakeholder who can now probably tell me how my implementation is wrong. It's very rare that a requirement can't be clarified after this process, though it might take a couple of rounds of revisions to let the stakeholder really refine what they're envisioning.</p>
